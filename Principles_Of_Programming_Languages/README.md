# Principles of Programming Languages Project – Multi-language Comparison

This project was completed for the course **CS213 – Principles of Programming**, during my **2nd year (Fall 2024)** at Qassim University.  
It explores how different programming paradigms express the same logic in distinct ways by implementing simple programs in three languages.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

The project focuses on comparing three programming paradigms:
- **Procedural** – using Pascal  
- **Functional** – using Scheme  
- **Logic-based** – using Prolog  

As part of the assignment, each team member implemented a set of basic programs across all three languages.

I personally implemented the following three programs, each in **Pascal**, **Scheme**, and **Prolog**:
1. **Largest of Three Numbers**  
2. **Word Counter** – counts the number of words in a sentence  
3. **Multiplication Table** – displays the table for a given number

These program titles are highlighted in **blue** inside the attached report.  
Each version of the code (for all three languages) is included in this repository.

📝 The theoretical part of the report — including research, explanation, and comparison — was done collaboratively with my team.  
We worked together to write, refine, and review the final content.

## 🛠️ Languages & Online Tools Used

- **Pascal** – tested using [OnlineGDB - Pascal Compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_pascal_compiler)  
- **Scheme** – tested using [Replit – Scheme Interpreter](https://replit.com/@replit/Scheme?v=1#main.scm)  
- **Prolog** – tested using [SWISH (SWI-Prolog Web IDE)](https://swish.swi-prolog.org)

> All code was written and tested using online interpreters and compilers for simplicity and accessibility.
