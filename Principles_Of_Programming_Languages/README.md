# Multi-Paradigm Programming Comparison

A comparative study implementing identical algorithms across three different programming paradigms: Procedural (Pascal), Functional (Scheme), and Logic-based (Prolog).

---

## Overview

This project explores how different programming paradigms approach the same problems. By implementing the same three programs in Pascal, Scheme, and Prolog, it demonstrates the fundamental differences between procedural, functional, and logic-based programming approaches.

---

## Implemented Programs

Each of the following programs was implemented in all three languages:

1. **Largest of Three Numbers** - Determines the maximum value among three inputs
2. **Word Counter** - Counts the number of words in a given sentence
3. **Multiplication Table** - Displays the multiplication table for a specified number

## Programming Paradigms Explored

### Procedural Programming (Pascal)
- Sequential execution of statements
- Use of variables and control structures
- Imperative approach with explicit state management

### Functional Programming (Scheme)
- Functions as first-class citizens
- Recursion instead of loops
- Immutable data and minimal side effects

### Logic Programming (Prolog)
- Declarative approach using facts and rules
- Pattern matching and unification
- Automatic backtracking for solutions

## Key Comparisons

| Aspect | Pascal | Scheme | Prolog |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Paradigm** | Procedural | Functional | Logic-based |
| **Iteration** | Loops (for, while) | Recursion | Backtracking |
| **Variables** | Mutable | Immutable | Logical variables |
| **Execution** | Sequential | Expression evaluation | Goal satisfaction |
| **Syntax** | Verbose, structured | Minimal, parentheses | Predicates and clauses |
